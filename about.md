My name is Jonathan Rodgers. As a student at a very small school, which has less than 200 total enrolled students k-12, I have had minimal exposure to digital fabrication. However, I have much experience building things (houses, chairs, tables, etc.). Much of this experience is due to my small town country roots and growing up on a 50 acre hobby farm. While I do not enjoy farming, I love to play sports. Specifically I play soccer, as a goal keeper, and golf. I look forward to learning how to assemble circuit boards, program, and digitally design and fabricate objects.
