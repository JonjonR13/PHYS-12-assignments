THis week we worked with cnc machines and making composites with epoxy and canvas. Speifically, Carmelo and I made a model MHjilnir aka THor's hammer from avengers. The design was made with a basic fusion 360 program.

This is the first thing we did. We made a rectangle and extruded it into a box. NExt, we modified the edges using the chamfer capability to make the edges have another dimension and look more like the real life model.

After this we extracted a circle by first creating a center diameter circle, and then extracting and chemfering it the same mm as the edges of the hammer head.

Next you will use a modify feature called split body and you are going to select the two sides of the hammer and it will automatically split the body in half. After you have made the model, you will need to save as an STL file and export to your cnc software and make a rough cut. 
After making a rough cut and using your dimentsions to cut out a fine cut you will prepare the surface by placing a layer of plastic wrap over the foam.

NEXT, mix your apoxy of choice (we used 2 pumps of A one apoxy by supersap mixed with one pump of B ONS hardener also by supersap.).

Next apply the epoxy to two or three pieces of canvas and layer the canvas and apoxy over the hammer.

After this you will layer a piece of cotton absorbant on top and place in a vacuum seal bag, and lastly, you will seal and vacuum the vacuum sealable bag.

 This composite will need to cure for 10 hours so sit back and watch Stranger Things season Three (you can do it) lol.
