OVer the course of this week we learned how to design on fusion 360, upload our designs to a laser cutter as a DXF file, and cut our designs out of cardboard and plywood!

First things first you must download the Fusion 360 software from autodesk, after making an account with autodesk, obviously. Next, just explore the software, make shapes, extrude objects, put holes in designs, sketch some stuff, etc. Your capability to create is all controlled by how creative you want to be, so you should be really creative. Expirement!!
Here is a picture of my first sketch in route to a circular notched press fit kit frame to make a trash can out of cardboard!

After making a sketch of what ever you want (I highly recommend using mirror and offset capabilities in the sketch tab if you want to make a press fit!), you can extrude the image by clicking the extrude button at the top left of the screen, selecting a sketch, and setting the diameter.

After extruding the sketch into a 3d object, click P on your keyboard and select your body that you just created. Then right click on your sketch that now has a red pin on it its label on the left hand drop down menu and save flie as a dxf. Import this dxf file to your laser printing, or other cutting device, go scale and make sure the material you are using is large enough to be used. THen when you are all set up with whatever laser cutter you are using start and hopefully it works! :).
Here are som objects I designed and cut!
