### Programming Arduino

This week was on Programming arduino, using for loops, if/ else statements, makeing logical components from physical commponents, and learning the general functions for arduino.
For my assignment i decided to make a simple program that would run through a for loop ten times if 6 secconds had passed and the button was pushed. 
Here is the code for that program and a short video and description of how everything goes together.
