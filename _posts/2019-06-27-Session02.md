### Reading Currents and Programming Arduino  

Today, we learned to read currents, navigate microchips, and to program our arduino boards to also read voltage, currents, and thus, discover the resistance of resistors. Here is a link to Nathan Melenbrink's presentation, [Intro to Microchips](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/02_tools/micro.html). This presentation was very informative and has given me much to study and understand. 

 After the presentation we continued and learned to measure the currents and voltage on the arduino board.

After experimenting with the arduino boards and calculating the resistance of resistors and the usage of LEDs, we added a program to the arduino uno to make the arduino able to measure volts and currents.
