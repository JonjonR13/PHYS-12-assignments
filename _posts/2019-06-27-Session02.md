### Reading Currents and Programming Arduino  

Today, we learned to read currents, navigate microchips, and to program our arduino boards to also read voltage, currents, and thus, discover the resistance of resistors. Here is a link to Nathan Melenbrink's presentation, [Intro to Microchips](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/02_tools/micro.html). This presentation was very informative and has given me much to study and understand. 

 After the presentation we continued and learned to measure the currents and voltage on the arduino board.

After experimenting with the arduino boards and calculating the resistance of resistors and the usage of LEDs, we added a program to the arduino uno to make the arduino able to measure volts and currents.

<h1> Cutting and Joining Materials</h1>
<p1> Today we learned how use a variety of devices and joining techniques, including: drill press, razor, hacksaw, saw, hand-held  drill, glueing, and bolting. 
	The first thing we did was go over the multiple safety procedures for the devices as we approached them. For the box 
cutter, we only cut when there are no object in the path of the blade other than the object we are intending to cut or destroy. For the drill press and hand drill we learned, we learned to turn off the machines when changing bits and when we are not using them. THe same rules for the razor apply to the hacksaw and hand-held saw. 
Below are some pictures of the objects we practiced on.</p1>

After cutting multiple we joined them together using super glue and wood glue, depending on the objects joined, obviously.
We also cut cardboard sheets for the laser cutter, which will be used at a later date!
