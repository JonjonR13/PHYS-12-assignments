### Rapid Prototyping

<h2>7-10-2019:</h2>
Today we made our first prototype! My prototype is a robot trash can, basicaaly a r2d2 trash can lol.

This is it completed! I started with just a simple structure made using the info from week 3. Click the link below to learn 2d creation!!!

After building up my simple structure and making in lays for the motors, I set my rig ,that I made for my final project, which can be learned about if you click on the link below!, in to my structure and hotglued everything together, using a HOTGLUE GUN. WHat?! Surprise! you have your project complete. LOL JK. Actually, it takes quite a lot more effort to actually make it drive around lol.

Now you need to make your robot able to move, so you need to give it some wheels or tracks or something that will make it move! i chose wheels and used lego gears and hotglue to stick my gears and wheels to the platform!

Lego bricks are actually super helpful if you don't have access to a 3d printer or somthing that would create a similar rig!
If you are really feeling xtra or your bot isn't balanced add more wheels and stabilizers! more wheels the better!

This is the rig for the internal hardware! You will need a motordriver, wires, arduino uno, external power source, dc geared motors, and a ardiuno uno for this project!
