### Rapid Prototyping

<h2 style="color:aqua;">7-10-2019:</h2>

Today we made our first prototype! My prototype is a robot trash can, basicaaly a r2d2 trash can lol.

<p1 style="color:aqua;">This is it completed! I started with just a simple structure made using the info from week 3. Click the link below to learn 2d creation!!!</p1>

<p1 style="color:aqua;"> After building up my simple structure and making in lays for the motors, I set my rig ,that I made for my final project, which can be learned about if you click on the link below!, in to my structure and hotglued everything together, using a HOTGLUE GUN. WHat?! Surprise! you have your project complete. LOL JK. Actually, it takes quite a lot more effort to actually make it drive around lol. </p1>

<p1 style="color:aqua;">Now you need to make your robot able to move, so you need to give it some wheels or tracks or something that will make it move! i chose wheels and used lego gears and hotglue to stick my gears and wheels to the platform!</p1>

<p1 style="color:aqua;">Lego bricks are actually super helpful if you don't have access to a 3d printer or somthing that would create a similar rig!
If you are really feeling xtra or your bot isn't balanced add more wheels and stabilizers! more wheels the better!</p1>

<p1 style="color:aqua;">This is the rig for the internal hardware! You will need a motordriver, wires, arduino uno, external power source, dc geared motors, and a ardiuno uno for this project!</p1>
