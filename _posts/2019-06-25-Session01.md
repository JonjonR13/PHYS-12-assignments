### ARDUINO UNO

Wednesday, June 26, 2019 15:15-18:15 

Today we messed around with arduino boards. Primarly, I expiremented with led lights and programming; however, being my first encounter with an arduino board it took myslef the majority of the lab to figure out how they worked. FIrst and foremost you need some supplies obviously. 

required materials:
- Arduino board
- Arduino Uno or nano
- electricity conducting wire 
- resistors 100 should be sufficiant
- led light
- Power supply 
- Power supply cable usbc to usb 3.0

First off, connected ground and 5v power cables to the strips running along the board. After that, I connected the power strip to the perpendicular strip where I would place my led light. I then established my led, resistor, and ground cable as shown in the picture below. 

After expirimenting with the different connectors, leds, and switches/ buttons, I came to the setup shown below. After this I plugged in my computer, installed the free Arduino IDE software and started to program using the examples found in the files tab in the upper right hand corner of the arduino ide software window.
