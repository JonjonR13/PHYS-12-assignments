### Input devices

<body style="background-color:lightgrey; background-image: url(https://www.trzcacak.rs/myfile/detail/79-799700_clip-art-library-library-creative-idea-light-bulb.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; font-family: courier;">

Today we learned how to use input devices and code on arduino how to calibrate them and have them as influencers in our digfab lives. Using a buzzer, copper sensor to sense touch, a touch sensor library, and a motor, I am going to boild a touch enabled trash can lid that opens when button is touched and makes an r2d2 sound. 
FIrst things first download a library specifically the blue highlighted one.

Next, you are going to include this code in your setup and pre setup:
(#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7, 5);



void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);

  // put your setup code here, to run once:

})
It should look like this:

Next, we are going to make an if/ else program stating that when the sensor value is greater than 800 or whatever you want the sensor value to be, a certain thing happens in this case my program is going to run a loop 1 time in which it will allow a motor to spin one direction for a few seconds. In order to get a better value you will have to use the 
[MAP](file:///C:/Program%20Files/WindowsApps/ArduinoLLC.ArduinoIDE_1.8.21.0_x86__mdqgnx93n4wtt/reference/www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Map.html) 
function to tune to you specs.
