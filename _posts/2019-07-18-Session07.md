### Input devices

Today we learned how to use input devices and code on arduino how to calibrate them and have them as influencers in our digfab lives. Using a buzzer, copper sensor to sense touch, a touch sensor library, and a motor, I am going to boild a touch enabled trash can lid that opens when button is touched and makes an r2d2 sound. 
FIrst things first download a library specifically the blue highlighted one.

Next, you are going to include this code in your setup and pre setup:
(#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7, 5);



void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);

  // put your setup code here, to run once:

})
It should look like this:
