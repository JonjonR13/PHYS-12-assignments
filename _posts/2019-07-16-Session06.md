### 3D Printing

This week we worked on 3d printing and learning 3d design in fusion 360 and exporting that to a slicer which then exports an stl file to the printer which prints the object. For my assignment I decided to make a fidget with a ball inside.
HEre are the steps in fusion 360 to get that fidget.

First, you will want to make a square and extract it or just use the create function and create a cube.

Next, you will want to use the modify feature to "Chamfer" the edges. So, select all six edges when it is time to select and then select 10 mm for how much.

After this hollow out the object using the hollow feature and select all 6 square sides, only the square sides and holow to the inside to a width of 2mm.

Next create a sphere that will fit inside the cube but small enough to be moveable within the enclosure. This is simple: create sphere.

THe next thing you will do is upload or export to a slicer. In the slicer of your choice you will be able to change the specs of the slic to make it stronger, more precise, less precise, or whater you want it to be. Now, slice and export to the printer using a usb driver or a sd card.

THis specific build wouldve been almost impossible using destructive construction because it is a shape inside an enclosure that doesn't have an opening large enough for the shape to fit through so carving this out of a block of wood with a saw, knife, or laser would have likely been impossible because of the multidimensions of the piece. It is also much more convenient to use additive construction like 3d printing because it is printed all as one piece, which makes it sturdier and more visually appealling.
