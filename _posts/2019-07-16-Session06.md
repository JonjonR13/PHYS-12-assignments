### 3D Printing


<body style="background-color:lightgrey; background-image: url(http://empoweredforexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dollarphotoclub_72421384-1200x900.jpg); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; font-family: courier;">

This week we worked on 3d printing and learning 3d design in fusion 360 and exporting that to a slicer which then exports an stl file to the printer which prints the object. For my assignment I decided to make a fidget with a ball inside.
HEre are the steps in fusion 360 to get that fidget.

First, you will want to make a square and extract it or just use the create function and create a cube.

Next, you will want to use the modify feature to "Chamfer" the edges. So, select all six edges when it is time to select and then select 10 mm for how much.

After this hollow out the object using the hollow feature and select all 6 square sides, only the square sides and holow to the inside to a width of 2mm.

Next create a sphere that will fit inside the cube but small enough to be moveable within the enclosure. THis is simply creat, then sphere.
