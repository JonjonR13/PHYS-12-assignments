### PROject Proposal

Using all the skills learned in this class over the next six weeks, I plan to build a vehicle capable of locomotion in the water and on the ground, also known as an amphibious vehicle. The vehicles frame will be made out of a trash can and primary purpose will be a trash can. I want to make a trash can that takes the trash out itself:). 

Alternatively, I also could make a shopping cart that drove itself or self propelled longboard or bicycle; however, I really like the idea of making a trash can that takes itself out when full!

Additionally, I would like to add sensors to know when the trash can is getting to heavy so that the automatic trashcan can always take out the trash. Also, it will have  maybe a compactor or a way of compressing the trash and dropping it in a predetermined location programmed into the bots gps or a like system, so it can go from stay/ home location to the drop location.
