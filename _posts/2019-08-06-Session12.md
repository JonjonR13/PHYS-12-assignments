### PROject Proposal

Using all the skills learned in this class over the next six weeks, I plan to build a vehicle capable of locomotion in the water and on the ground, also known as an amphibious vehicle. The vehicles frame will be made out of a trash can and primary purpose will be a trash can. I want to make a trash can that takes the trash out itself:). 

Alternatively, I also could make a shopping cart that drove itself or self propelled longboard or bicycle; however, I really like the idea of making a trash can that takes itself out when full!
