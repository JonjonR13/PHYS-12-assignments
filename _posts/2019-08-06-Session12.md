### PROject Proposal

Using all the skills learned in this class over the next six weeks, I plan to build a vehicle capable of locomotion in the water and on the ground, also known as an amphibious vehicle. The vehicles frame will be made out of a trash can and primary purpose will be a trash can. I want to make a trash can that takes the trash out itself:). 

Alternatively, I also could make a shopping cart that drove itself or self propelled longboard or bicycle; however, I really like the idea of making a trash can that takes itself out when full!

Additionally, I would like to add sensors to know when the trash can is getting to heavy so that the automatic trashcan can always take out the trash. Also, it will have  maybe a compactor or a way of compressing the trash and dropping it in a predetermined location programmed into the bots gps or a like system, so it can go from stay/ home location to the drop location.

<h1 style="color:aqua;"> Update UNO </h1>
<p1> After much struggling with the arduino uno I have mmade progress. Progress, meaning that I am now able to control 2 motors simultaneously in both directions, brake, and accelorate to different speeds using pwm. While this is just a minor part of this project, locomotion is very important, and this is how I did it. 
First off, I got a motor driver; to be more specific I got an L298N motor driver. This is a VERY important part of this project. The motor driver allows me to move the motors in different dirrections at the same time, which allows the to be automated trash can to turn. You also need some wire, an arduino uno, nano, or something like it, and a geared dc motor , or two. ALso, you are gonna need a computer and cable to connect to the arduino. 
After you have accumalated all the suppies necassary we are going to start connecting the arduino and L298N. You are going to this starting with the in cables you should put a wire from in_1 on the motordriver to a digital number 6-13 on the arduino. then you will do this with in_2, in_3, and in_4, also. Then connect the ena on the motor driver to a analog. This analog is going to allow you to modulate the speed at which the motor turns. Connect your motors to the out(1-4). These outs are given power by the in_1-4 by the way. So to program this you are going to set your analog write to whater analog number port you used. Also set your other digitalWrite as the numbers you chose also. Here is my code:void setup() {
    //Setup Channel A
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT); //Initiates Motor Channel A pin
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT); //Initiates Brake Channel A pin
  //Setup Channel B
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); //Initiates Motor Channel B pin
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);  //Initiates Brake Channel B pin
  }
void loop(){
  //Motor A forward @ full speed
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH); //Establishes forward direction of Channel A
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);   //Disengage the Brake for Channel A
  analogWrite(3, 255);   //Spins the motor on Channel A at full speed
  //Motor B backward @ half speed
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  //Establishes backward direction of Channel B
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   //Disengage the Brake for Channel B
  analogWrite(2, 123);    //Spins the motor on Channel B at half speed
  delay(10000);
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);  //Engage the Brake for Channel A
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  //Engage the Brake for Channel B
  delay(10000);
  //Motor A forward @ full speed
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);  //Establishes backward direction of Channel A
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);   //Disengage the Brake for Channel A
  analogWrite(3, 123);    //Spins the motor on Channel A at half speed
  //Motor B forward @ full speed
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); //Establishes forward direction of Channel B
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   //Disengage the Brake for Channel B
  analogWrite(2, 255);   //Spins the motor on Channel B at full speed
  delay(10000);
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);  //Engage the Brake for Channel A
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  //Engage the Brake for Channel B
  delay(1000);
